          Mānā: Arid An ahupua‘a of the Kona district. Also a ridge. The western
          boundary abuts the rugged cliffs of Miloli‘i and Nā Pali; the eastern
          border Wai‘awa ahupua‘a. Originally the land slopes from the
          mountains, drops over a cliff-like formation, and then consists of a
          reedy marsh with open ponds, and the long sand dunes and beaches
          lining its entire length. *During the twelfth century, many voyaging
          canoes traveled between Kahiki and Hawai’i. One of these paddlers
          settled at Mānā, having come to admire ka moena hohola o Mānā, the
          unfolding mat of Mānā. He lived on the one kani, barking sands, and
          could look north to Polihale and south to Waimea and see nothing but
          an unending sandy beach. He went to visit a friend in Kona in Hawai’i
          but soon became homesick and brought his friend with him to show him
          the beauties of ka moena hohola o Mānā, the unfolding mat of Mānā.

          One section of the dunes are called The Barking Sands, because any
          disturbance of the sand causes a far-away sound of dogs barking.
          Ke-one-kani-o-Nohili, The-barking-sands-of-Nohili Large sand dunes at
          Kapu-`ai point where the Mānā coastline angles sharply to the west.
          [PEM] [POP][Geo] [Alex 1900] *Nohili, Tedious and slow, was a
          fisherman who had nine dogs. When he canoed out to sea, he tethered
          the dogs, tying three to each of three sturdy pegs driven into the
          sand. Once he was caught in a terrible storm which blew him almost to
          Nihoa Island. The nine dogs barked and barked, first to warn him, then
          to guide him home. They jumped, turned, twisted, and spun around and
          around their pegs, constantly barking. When Nohili reached home again,
          he found no trace of the dogs except great circles around each of the
          pegs. But as he walked, he heard his dogs barking deep inside the sand
          where, in their frenzy, they had dug themselves.

          (Pukui 2468) The marshes teemed with marsh and ocean birds. The mirage
          of Mānā was famous and could often be seen at twilight on the nights
          of Kāne. [Geo] *When she came to Kaua`i, Kapo-kina’u-’ula introduced
          the lei made of kauna’oa-lei, Cuscuta sandwichiana Choisy, a
          parasitical vine with orange stems, native to these islands. It was
          called "the motherless plant" because it is a parasite. Kauna’oa vine,
          vine of Mānā How I love that orphan vine A proverb applied to a loved
          individual who has no home or family. [Neal:710]

          Kapo-kina’u-`ula was a goddess of the hula, practitioner of medicine
          (especially mental diseases), and of poison. She was the sister of
          Pele, the volcano goddess, and of Nā-maka-o-kaha’i, goddess of the
          ocean. She came to Kaua’i from the west when Mano-ka-lani-pō was
          Ruling Chief, circa 1200 A.D. She married one of her hand-maidens,
          Moe-haunaka, to Limaloa (konohiki chief of Mānā, brother of Lohiau,
          Pele`s lover who became Hi’iaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele`s husband). *See
